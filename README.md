The project name ‘Morphological Recommender’ was aimed at designing and developing a generic recommendation engine and an intuitive visualization technique for the same.
The user is allowed to feed a large dataset into the system which is then cleansed and filtered according the user’s wishes.
After the preprocessing is completed it is fed into a recommendation engine which helps in visually navigating the different recommendations given to the user.
